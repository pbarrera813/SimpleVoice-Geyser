A Geyser Extension to allow Bedrock Clients to connect with Simple voice Chat.

## What can the Plugin/extension do?
- Allow Bedrock Players to voice chat with Java Players through a web interface.
- Configured to also allow Java Players without the SVC Mod to join the chat.

## Using this Plugin
- Set the '.jar' file into your server's plugin directory.
- Configure it to connect with your server's SimpleVoice chat. See [Installation](https://theodoremeyer.github.io/projects/simplevoicegeyser/install)

### Updating
- Replacing the old jar with the new one.
     - I plan on making config options auto update.

## Documentation
- Our [wiki](https://theodoremeyer.github.io/projects/simplevoicegeyser/) can help!

- old wiki: [wiki](https://github.com/TheodoreMeyer/SimpleVoice-Geyser/wiki).

## Coming Soon
- Dev Release (v 0.1.2-Dev)
- Initial Release (v 1.0.0)

## Features to be worked on
- External Webserver (you host the vc connection at your website)
- Support
  - Velocity
- More Web browser support.

## Suggestions?
Reach out through issues!

## Dependencies used
- [Geysermc.org](https://geysermc.org)
- [Jetty.org](https://jetty.org)
- SimpleVoiceChat: [ModRepo.de](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/overview)
- Bcrypt:          [Mindrot.org](https://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/)

## Important Notes
- Simple Voice Chat 2.6.0 or compatible is required to work, It must run on the server.
- GeyserMC 2.9.0-SNAPSHOT or compatible is required to work, It must run on the server.
- Java 21 or newer is required to build this project from source.

- Microphone/Speaker options may or may not work, depending on your browser, as this was built for Google Chrome.

## Audio Transport Migration (PR #45)
- `server.audio.transport-mode`: `auto` (default), `legacy`, `svg-v2`
- `server.audio.allow-legacy-fallback`: `true` (default during migration)

`auto` keeps compatibility by defaulting to legacy PCM transport when client capabilities are missing or unsupported, and uses `svg-v2` only when the client reports compatible decoder support in a secure context.

## Developer Notes
- Please see the contributing.md before contributing to this project.
